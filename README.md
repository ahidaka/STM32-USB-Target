# STM32-USB-Target

## Introduction

We will check and test STM32 series development kit to inspect USB target connectivity of Windows.

Target boards:
- STM32F746 Discovery kit
- STM32 Nucleo-144 for STM32L552 ultra-lowpower MCUs
- STM32 Nucleo-F411RE Nucleo-64 development board with STM32F411RE MCU
- and some other boards

At first, we will challenge to investigate STM32F746 with STM32CubeF7.
